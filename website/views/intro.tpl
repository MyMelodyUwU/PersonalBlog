<h1>Introduction</h1>

<tr>I have been developing ever since 2019, and I have been interested in security engineering ever since 2018. I have completed 2 official computing courses in High School and I have done many more online. I am able to write in any language, as long as I have a man page and syntax guide. I personally don't find myself interested in a developer role compared to others, but I am able perform full-stack tasks. Which is the reason why I aim to be a Red-teamer for Atlassian after graduating university. I favour the ideas of network penetration or OSINT challenges. Within a CTF, I am usually in charge of forensic or stenography challenges. Which I am using my own tools to dissect to find information. Which I map using software like Maltego to record findings in order for various exploitations.

<tr>In 2020, I have also mentored (Unoffically) MQ university students for COMP 1000. My major concern for first year computing is the 50% fail rate in the first course. Which I ended up questioning, is it the exexecution of the content, or is the right mentality of computer science not instilled to the students? <br>  
It generally drove my own passion to write blogs to first years to properly show them the fundermentals of computer science. </tr> <br>

<tr> If you are new to computer science, please follow along. I'll tell and rant a lot of things. <br>
if not, enjoy the rest of my blog and portfolio. </tr>
