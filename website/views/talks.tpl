    <td>My first ever talk to a small group of students. It was an introduction as we dive into the open world that is becoming more "public until you make it private", then "private until you make it public". In my talk I gave the students 3 tasks. <br> The first task was called the electrican task, where were given 4 questions to ground our mentality within reality, and we all learnt in the end that a form of protecting something, is that we don't reveeal what it is. <br> The second task was the phishing email, which my friends wrote a few phishing emails and as a group we uncovered how an email provider prevented spam. <br> The last one was the infosec mission, where we uncovered how infomation can be abused, dependant on what is provided to them. </td>
